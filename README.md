Hackintosh on Dell 5570

Specs :

Cpu : Intel i5-8250u at 1.6ghz (Kabylake-r)
Gpu : Intel UHD620
Ram : 8gb ddr4 2400ghz
Hard disk : I replaced the standard hd with a Samsung 860 evo and I added a Samsung 860evo at m2 slot. 
Wifi/bt : Factory qualcomm won't work. I replaced it with a Broadcomm 94360CS2 working natively. Fingerprint sensor : Won't work with mac, so I disabled it. 
Card reader : I don't need it , so I disabled it from bios.

What is working : Pretty much everything...

CPU management : native cpu management 
Battery managment : getting 4,5-5 hours , with browsing , music and office editing. Better that windows 10 !!! 
Audio : working great including headphones. 
Sleep/wake : lid close / open working as it should.
Precision touchpad : working close to a real mac , with almost all gestures.
Brighness / volume control : fn + F1,F2,F3,F4 for volume , fn+F11,F12 for display brighness. 
Camera : ok

What we need : I will not get into details. You can read the great guides at forum for getting a usb installer.

Some notes :

	✓	Dispaly analysis is set to 1920x1080 (default). If you find (like me) that fonts are too small you can use a scaled one (like 1600x900). Or you can run one-key-hidpi-master to get HDIPI , too.

	✓	You have to implement proper usb management, following this guide :guide-creating-a-custom-ssdt-for-usbinjectall-kext.211311. This is very importart!!! I've already placed a ssdt for usb , but be sure to check if it is working ok for your system , too. As I said I've disabled card reader and fingerprint sensor , as they don't work on hackintosh.

	✓	Uncheck smart zoom at preferences/trackpad.

	✓	Install codecommander.kext at l/e with proper permissions.

	✓	Get yourself a serial number in config.plist/smbios.

	✓	There is a Bios editing section at the end of this section. If you don't follow it you won't ne able to boot with the current OC folder.

OpenCore Update 1/1/21

•	Update OC and kexts to latest version 0.6.4

•	Update smbios to 16,3

•	Replaced ACPI patch BRT6 with BrightnessKeys.kext

•	More SSDT and Config.plist optimization


BIG SUR UPDATE  14/8/20

•	Update OC and kexts to latest version  (see note 1)

•	Revert back to smbios 15,2.

•	SSDT's and config.plist optimisation.

•	Solved audio from headphones disappearing after sleep , with SSDT-HRT.aml. Needs more testimg    
       though.

note 1 : I use an older version of whatevergreen.kext , whick works on Big Sur but doesn't have the issue where aster waking from sleep gpu hangs at max frequency.



GUIDE FOR BIOS EDITING

To get a fully optimise Macos you should change some setting in BIOS. This is very dangerous and could lead to a bricked laptop. Use it at your own risk. You have been warned !!!!

If you still want to try then :

Follow this guide : http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/tutorial-xps-15-9550-9550-bios-advanced-options.810307/

and change these settings:

DVMV PRE-ALLOCATED set to 64MB: setup_var 0x795 0x2

DVMT TOTAL GFX MEM set to MAX: setup_var 0x796 0x3

CFG Lock
set to Disabled: setup_var 0x4ED 0x0

I2CO INTERUPT MODE set to GPIO Interrupt : setup_var 0x272 0x0
